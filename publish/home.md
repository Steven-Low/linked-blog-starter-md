### Help 
- Supports most Obsidian syntax (e.g. Link Previews,  Links, etc.). Uses [obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export).
- URLs are based on folder structure
- Backlinks can be added outside of the markdown files (using the [PreviewLink](https://github.com/matthewwong525/linked-blog-starter/blob/main/components/misc/preview-link.tsx) component)
- Full-text search
